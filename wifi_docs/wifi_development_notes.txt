Adding connectivity to the Mailbox PCB can be done with an ESP32 module. 
	Perferably one that is FCC approved which would remove the need for FCC testing (which costs several thousands of dollars)
	
	
	

The Communication protocols:
	CRUCIAL: WIFI for the average consumer and basic control with an app and maybe Alexa/google home
	EXTRA: Ethernet for a more reliable signal and neighborhood installations. maybe we can run the artnet device universe
	
	


The following esp modules are being considered: 
all of them have 
	4 mb of flash
	ipx connector for antenna but they also have a pcb antenna version (1U=ipx 1= pcb antenna) for about the same price. 
	ESP espressif build system.
